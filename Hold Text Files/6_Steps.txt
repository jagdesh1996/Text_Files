STEP ONE
“FIX IN YOUR MIND THE EXACT AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU DESIRE. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT MERELY TO SAY ‘I WANT PLENTY OF MONEY.’ BE DEFINITE AS TO THE AMOUNT.”


STEP TWO
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT YOU INTEND TO GIVE IN RETURN FOR THE MONEY YOU DESIRE. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.


STEP THREE
ESTABLISH A DEFINITE DATE WHEN YOU INTEND TO POSSESS THE MONEY YOU DESIRE.

STEP FOUR
CREATE A DEFINITE PLAN FOR CARRYING OUT YOUR DESIRE AND BEGIN AT ONCE, WHETHER YOU ARE READY OR NOT, TO PUT THIS PLAN INTO ACTION.
Write out your starting point and your end goal.


STEP FIVE
WRITE OUT A CLEAR, CONCISE STATEMENT OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU INTEND TO ACQUIRE, NAME THE TIME LIMIT FOR ITS ACQUISITION, STATE WHAT YOU INTEND TO GIVE IN RETURN FOR THE MONEY, AND DESCRIBE CLEARLY THE PLAN THROUGH WHICH YOU INTEND TO ACCUMULATE IT.


STEP SIX
READ YOUR WRITTEN STATEMENT ALOUD, TWICE DAILY, ONCE JUST BEFORE RETIRING AT NIGHT, AND ONCE AFTER ARISING IN THE MORNING. AS YOU READ, SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.
